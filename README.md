# Musical Compositions by Christopher Kies
Data Catalogue: Works by American Composer, Christopher Kies

I began this project in December of 2024 primarily for the sake of practicing JavaScript using real-world data. All of the information is drawn from the composer's website, hosted on Squarespace. It never had occurred to me to distill the data from the design. By focussing purely on the entries in Kies' catalogue, however, I am discovering imperfections previously overlooked. In addition to being a source of inspiration for future projects, coding is proving to be a useful content editing tool.
