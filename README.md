# Musical Compositions by Christopher Kies
Data Catalogue: Works by American Composer, Christopher Kies

I began this project in December of 2024 primarily for the sake of practicing JavaScript using real-world data. All of the information is drawn from the composer's website, hosted on Squarespace, which I currently maintain. It never before occurred to me to reverse the design process, however, by focussing on the entries in Kies' catalogue, I am discovering imperfections previously overlooked. Beyond the boundaries of practice, coding is proving to be a useful content editing tool.

This README will be updated as the trajectory of the project comtinues to reveal itself.
